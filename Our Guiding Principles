About Our Playbook

Hello, my name is Felipe Farias. I'm the founder and CEO at Vinta, and this is our playbook. 

For over a decade, Vinta has stood as a steadfast partner in the journey to create succeeding digital products across different industries. Our core expertise is crafting and scaling software solutions for rapidly growing businesses.

This playbook is a testimonial to our journey, principles, and the values that drive us forward. It's a chronicle of our experiences in the ever-evolving world of software development.

Vinta was founded in May 2013 when Flávio Juvenal, Filipe Ximenes, and I, three young developers from Recife, Brazil, came together around a shared vision. It was not just about writing code; we believed that exceptional software engineering meant combining technical skills with a deep understanding of the vision and needs of business founders to help their products thrive.
To achieve our mission, we prioritized the significance of our people. We created a workplace where every team member experienced respect, attentive listening, and acknowledgment. This approach has played a pivotal role in our company's growth, enabling us to attract and nurture exceptionally talented individuals.

Moreover, our commitment extends beyond client projects. We have a strong tradition of actively contributing to the open-source community. Over the years, we have established ourselves as seasoned speakers at prominent events like PyCon and DjangoCon, making substantial contributions to the global Python community. With more than a decade of experience, we have shared our knowledge through over 30 presentations at international conferences, authored over 80 articles on a wide range of subjects, and maintained an extensive portfolio of 160+ open-source repositories.
This playbook is a living testament to our journey, reflecting where we've been and where we're headed. It’s but an invitation to learn and grow with us. While we've shared our plays that have worked for us, we encourage you to use these insights to shape your own path, adapting our experiences to your own journey. Together, let's continue building a brighter future through software.
