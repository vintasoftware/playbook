In order to achieve our goal to deliver CTO-level Django services we are constantly upgrading our __company__, how we __manage our Projects__ and how we __develop software__. Also, we [contribute a lot to open source communities](https://vinta.com.br/opensource). So we decided to make our moves, and why we do them, public as well! All of you are free to use, copy, rename or improve on this playbook, but please [read our creative commons license first.](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/)
