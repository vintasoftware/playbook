# Career Plan

We believe in creating the best learning environment possible here at Vinta. In order to do so, we need to show a clear way ahead for all collaborators. We know also that everyone grows in a different way and so there is no point in creating a line for people to follow, we need to go wider than that. That's why our levels are an unordered list of treats we think our collaborators need in order to become experts in our field. 

## Some Added Information

* We have four levels (Junior Developer, Developer, Senior Developer, Leader Developer);
* Each level is divided in a number of sub-levels:
    * Junior Developer: 3 sub-levels
    * Developer: 6 sub-levels
    * Senior Developer: 10 sub-levels
    * Leader Developer: âˆž sub-levels
* We review salaries at the end of experience period and every 6 months after that;
* We evaluate subjectively alongside the collaborator (it's not a top-down assessment, it's a mutual evaluation). Every point in the plan was devised **not** to have a binary response. Each point is evaluated on whether the collaborator fully achieves it;
* Each point can be evaluated as a Strenght, In process, Weakness or In need of Validation;
* Each collaborator has a personal spreadsheet where his/her plan is listed;
* To reach level X+1, the collaborator needs:
    * Strengths judged important from level X-1 and lower;
    * Substantial amount of Strengths in his own level;
    * Some Strengths from level X+1
* Points can be added or removed in the future, this is a snapshot, not set in stone.
