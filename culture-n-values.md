# Who we are
Vinta is a software consultancy focused on web projects. We like to work with Python and JavaScript tools, but we have an open mind to experiment and play with other languages and tools. Django and React are our specialties and we love working with APIs.

## Our philosophy
- People, not processes nor code, are the most important thing in software engineering.
- The client should always be aware of what is happening, be it good or bad.
- There is no such a thing as the best language or an only way to do things. Each project is unique, and requires its own tools.
- Code should be clean and tested so programmers feel happy and confident to work on.
- Refactoring is a recurrent need and should be regarded as any feature in the backlog.
- Because of the above, automated tests are a must. As long as you write them, choose whatever process you like the most.
- Code should be deployed early and often.
- Simple beats complex.
- However complex it is, there is always a simple way to explain it so everyone can understand.
- Community is one of the most important features of a programming language, keep this in mind when choosing one.
- Open source is tremendous. Make the most of it and remember to give it back whenever possible.

## Our commitments
- To keep a welcoming, safe, and healthy workplace so we all exchange experiences.
- To fight for mutual respect among everyone in the company regardless of gender, political position, sexual orientation, religious choice and race, so we all see one another as equals.
- To aid anyone to approve talks and attend conferences, so we all share what we’ve come to learn.
- To encourage open source contributions, so both we all and those we don't know grow together.
- To provide tooling and an environment that fosters growth and sharing.

## Our expectations
- A humble attitude to recognize failures, and the will to improve when they happen.
- Tolerance towards failure and sustained improvement.
- Open mindedness for learning and self-improvement.

# Things we will not tolerate
- Any kind of racism.
- Any kind of sexism.
- Any kind of prejudice.

# Why we believe in open source
We are community people, open source contributions are wonderful  and everyone is encouraged to do some. Since a lot of our coding uses open-source tools, maintaining our own open-source projects seems reasonable. So we encourage people to contribute as projects demands. We find that is one way to leave our company's mark in the community as well is to always fork using [Vinta's Github account](https://github.com/vintasoftware).

# What inspires us
For us, it's very important to acknowledge where our ideas came from. First, because we don't want to take credit from things that we didn't do and Second, because it helps to emphasize that everyone is free to learn, copy, and improve on what we are doing. Most of our references come from books we read, Startups and bright people from the developer’s community that have inspired us.

## Books
- **Rework** - Rework is our Bible here, we believe Basecamp has it spot-on regarding where we want to be as a company. It taught us to question growth and see it as a tool to increase value delivered to the customer, not as a necessity. Here, we’ve also learned that meetings are toxic, and much more. Ultimately, it gave us the faith that we can create a company different from the status-quo and still be successful and relevant. 

- **The Lean Startup and The Four Steps to the Epiphany** - We are not a Startup, but it doesn't stop us from thinking like one. We use the lean build-measure-learn cycle on everything we do. We are always revisiting our processes and iterating them. For us the key take is: validation. Be it something we want to experiment outside the company or inside with our employees, nothing is set in stone, everything needs to be validated.

- **Two Scoops of Django** - “Write code that you are proud of”. It is Vinta’s main statement. In this direction: Two Scoops of Django, from our friends PyDanny and Audrey Greenfield, helps us a lot to fuel our discussions regarding our Django Code.

- **Real-Life Responsive Web Design** - The way our web projects interact with users fascinates us. We focus on making users awesome with our deliveries, and the fact that we can do that with small alterations in how they use our software is great . [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/) sets great example by  continuously  introducing new discussions regarding user interaction and HTML/CSS good practices.

These books taught us something that lives on in our culture. Sometimes bringing us things we haven’t ever heard of, and other times just by asserting things we already had stumbled upon in our practice and use frequently in our day-to-day.

## Other Playbooks
Alongside the books we read, we also devoted a lot of time to research other playbooks and how other companies choose to open their methodologies and culture for the world to see. Their approach and playbooks vary widely, but the important thing is everyone is contributing to raising the level of process discussion worldwide and choosing openness instead of secrecy.

- [Y Combinator](https://playbook.samaltman.com/) - One of the few, if not the only, playbook from an investment company that we could find. They focus on sharing the knowledge they acquired from helping several startups succeed. Its chapters are well decoupled from each other and can bring valuable lessons 

- [Basecamp](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook) - We've also quoted Basecamp's printed book last section, but their playbook is also worth noting and has a lot to teach. They have found a nice workaround to the problem of letting some subjects open and stir the discussion without compromising some more sensible data. 

- [Valve](https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/apps/valve/Valve_NewEmployeeHandbook.pdf) - Valve shares with us a very distinct way of looking at management and how we share information inside the company. Their playbook has a cheerful approach and acknowledges that these changes are not always a bed of roses, but you can ponder the trade-offs and make either side work.

- [Google](https://rework.withgoogle.com/) - Thought it's organized more like a standalone site than properly a playbook, Google's Rework gives us quite a lot of insight in researches that they've done and how that affects their processes. This level of openness that shares even knowledge is one of the reasons Google is a reference in our field.

- [Thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com/playbook) - Thoughtbot's playbook is structured to cover all the phases of their production process. Dividing it by phase makes it easier for people to go exactly where they want. Although focusing less on the internal operations of the company, their takes on sales, hiring, and apprenticeship are well worth the reading.

- [Luminary Labs](http://www.slideshare.net/LuminaryLabs/the-human-company-playbook-version-10) - Before this playbook existed, Sara Holoubek did an excellent job advocating lengthy about how companies could go above the minimum line of benefits and start behaving more humanely. Recently they compiled not only their practices but also practices from multiple other companies. They are divided into sections that explain the importance of each benefit while listing many different ways that an interested company might implement them. It's a must read if you are interested in what benefits companies could offer.

- [Facebook](http://v1.benbarry.com/project/facebooks-little-red-book) - Playbooks can also be a great tool for inspire people and align people with principles that you want for your company. Facebook's playbook does a very good job at that, focusing on the magnitude of tasks developed there and inspiring feelings of grandeur about changing the way people communicate. It doesn't talk much about internal practices, but it's a very good example of an inspirational playbook.

- [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook) - Atlassian did an outstanding visual job on their playbook. Almost every part of the process, what they call "plays", is documented and has a video explaining how it works. The playbook is also full of templated documents that anyone can download and a set of tips to be read before testing the practices yourself. Although way more difficult to interact and generate a discussion than a typical, open-source playbook, Atlassian's compilation shows there is always a benefit if you can include more people in the conversation with different ways to show the same content.

- [Wemake](https://wemake.services/meta/rsdp) - Wemake has several definitions of their playbook, they chose to bring a lot of necessary technical clarifications to a more open discussion, such as "the definition of done", "creating issues", "closing issues" and so on. Another interesting thing they do is set Dealbreakers: criteria that define what types of clients they won't work with. We realize not all companies can do it, and need to work with anything just to keep the head above the water, but we also believe more companies should be doing something like this.
