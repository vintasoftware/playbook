## Design Expectations
The product design must start with a low fidelity wireframe and evolve into a user interface.

## Wireframe
- Desired format: PDF or a link to a mocking tool of your preference.

- Design for 12-column grid.
- When using Bootstrap, design for the container (1056px). Either way, the width must be explicit.
- wireframe must be mobile first, when applicable.
- Annotated wireframes are best, the flow must be textually explicit.
- Expected error states, form validation errors and rules must be clear.
- Use actual text content, even if not the final version.

## User Interface
- Interface must be responsive.
- Buttons states, links and alerts must be clear.
- Consistent typescale for all typefaces in the design is expected.
- Full color palette with hex values is desirable.
- Expected behavior of possible text overflows must be explicit.
- Proprietary fonts must be provided.
