## Start talking about yourself and what you do:
Here are some pointers to help you

- Who are you?
    - Your name
    - Experience
    - Things you like to work with

- About Vinta:
    - What we do?
    - What projects have we worked on?
    - Why do you like working at Vinta?

- Have an slide to talk about open source projects you've worked on.
- Let people know you are available during the conference to talk about yourself, the presentation or Vinta.
- Translate any citations to the language you are presenting on, otherwise you are going to have a hard time trying to translate them during the presentation. It's a lot easier to just read them.
- The last slide should stay in the screen while people make questions.
- The last slide should contain:
    - A shortened link to your slides (remember to upload it before the presentation)
    - Your contact information: Twitter, GitHub, etc
- After the last slide, add answers to the questions you that are very likely to be asked.
