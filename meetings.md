Along with providing the very best service while coding, __customer relationship is the most important thing in a project__ and meetings are a very important part of it.

## Scheduling
Use some app to make sure you are scheduling meetings for  the correct programmed time. We recommend World Time Buddy, which has mobile phone apps:

**Always send a calendar invite**. No matter how quick  you plan the meeting to be, make sure you send an invite. This is important so both you and the client never miss a meeting. Also, too many meetings is harmful for your productivity. Clientes should get used to scheduling meetings beforehand and not just hop in for a call at any time.

## Calendar notifications
You should configure your calendar to send you notifications one day before (e-mail) and 30 minutes before (preferably on your phone). [Here is how](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37242?hl=en) to configure the default notification scheme for your calendar. This is important so you don't miss the meeting and have time to check if everything is well.

## After the meeting
- Review your notes and add tasks to Trello. Remember if you said you would send something later to client and make sure it happens.
- Make sure there's a written version of the things discussed and decided for further reference. This should also be made accessible to the client (Trello cards help here as well).
